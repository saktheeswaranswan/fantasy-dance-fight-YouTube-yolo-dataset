What are your Top 10 Kannada movies and why?
Difficult to list just top 10 movies because there are way too many. But here's my top 10 in no particular order.

1. Mayura

Being a fan of history, I loved this movie. Definitely one of the best ever movies starring Dr Rajkumar

2. Lucia

Pawan Kumar did to Kannada cinema what Christopher Nolan did to Hollywood. Our answer to Inception is brilliant.

3. Om

The first ever movie on rowdyism was just epic and was instrumental in Upendra and Shivarajkumar's superstardom

4. Beladingala Bale

One of Anant Nag's best movies and even though the ending is a bit tragic, I loved watching the whole movie.

5. Nishkarsha

Wow this is probably one of its kind in Kannada cinema. A truly exceptional movie.

6. America America!

Again a great movie that had Ramesh in his typical Thyagaraj roles. The movie showed the difference between Indian and American culture beautifully.

7. Accident (Shankar Nag)

The movie showed the real truth in India where people of power can get away with ease. Salman Khan would definitely not like this amazing movie :D

8. A

Uppi is God and God is great! That's it, period.

9. Ulidavaru Kandante

Again a very unique movie which was the best of 2014 for me. Excellent effort by Rakshit Shetty

10. RangiTaranga

The latest entry to this list put Kannada cinema on the global map.
